# JS Experiment #1
### What even is webpack, and how does it webpack?

#### Dependencies
- node (I have 8.1.2 installed, but any node >=6 should work)
- yarn

#### How
Follow the sequence of commits on the master branch. We start with an HTML template file and some **rich** functionality in a js file. The goal is to have a single HTML file with inlined javascript. And we get there!
